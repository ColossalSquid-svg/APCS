Considering the following code, what is the value of d as a result?
int a = 3 + 2 * 3; // a = 9
int b = 4 + 3 / 2; // 3/2 results in java calculating 1. b = 5
int c = 7 % 4 + 3; // 7 % 4 calculates as 3 due to 3 being remainder. c = 6
double d = a + b + c; // d = 20

Consider the following code segment. Assume num is a properly declared and initialized int variable. Best describe the result of executing the code?
if (num > 0) // This line checks if num is positive
{
  if (num % 2 == 0) // This line then checks if num is an even integer. If true, print "A". Otherwise the code assumes that num is an odd integer, therefore print "B".
  {
    System.out.println("A");
  }
  else
  {
    System.out.println("B");
  }
}  // Because there isn't a print statement after the if statement, the best description would be 
// (When num is a positive even integer, "A" is printed; when num is a positive odd integer, "B" is printed; otherwise, nothing is printed.)

public static double getHours(int marker1, int marker2) // This code requires a statement to calculate the number of hours that a vehicle takes to travel between two mile markers on 
// a highway if the vehicle travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. A mile marker is a sign showing the number of miles along a road between some fixed location 
// (for example, the beginning of a highway) and the current location.
{
/* missing statement */ // For this statement, we need to find the distance between marker1 and marker2 and then divide it by 60, assuming the vehicle is travelling at a constant 60 mph.
return hours; // The distance between marker1 and marker2 cannot be negative because speed can never be negative, therefore we need the Math.abs to always print out a positive integer.
} // double hours = Math.abs(marker1 - marker2) / 60.0

Consider the following class definition. What constructor, if added to the Bird class, will cause a compilation error?
public class Bird
{
private String species;
private String color;
private boolean canFly;
public Bird(String str, String col, boolean cf) // In other for a compilation error to occur,
{
species = str;
color = col;
canFly = cf;
}
}
